# Analysis-and-classification-of-white-blood-cell-in-blood
Introduction:

As we are moving ahead in the time, Virus is also getting stronger due to which it very difficult to make medicine and treat them on time.So I decided to work on white blood cell classification and detection in the
human blood. 

White blood cell plays a major role in protecting the human from infections and virus which come inside our body. It also providing assistance to blood platelets during healing of the wound and kill all virus and
bacterial organism. 

There are 4 types of white blood cell that will we classified by using deep learning:

Eosinophil:
It is a specialized cell of the immune system which provide a high level of a disease-fighting white blood cell.
 
Lymphocytes:
These blood cells are formed in bone narrow and found in blood and lymph tissue.

Monocytes:
They are part of the vertebrate innate immune system and they have properties of adaptive immunity.

Neutrophils:
These white blood cells protect us from infection and made 40% to 60% of white blood cell in our body.


Case Study:

As we are in 2020 and facing one of the major viruses that are known by the name of coronavirus and it took the lives of many innocent people. Coronavirus starts its infections in many steps as list down below:

    1. It enters in your lung and starts infecting your white blood cell in your body.

    2. It creates confusion among white blood cell by infecting some them.

    3. This creates a problem for WBC to fight with them, as they cannot distinguish between a healthy cell and infected cell.

    4. The WBC uses protein which is known by name of the cytokine to control other immune cells, here coronavirus initiate reaction in which white blood cell starts destroying other immune cells.

    5. This results in huge loss of human body resources and makes our body vulnerable to other bacterial and parasitic infections.  

 So decide to make some intelligent agent which can help us to know about the status of the user%u2019s immune system by scanning white blood cell through image processing. Using my application, we can detect what type of cell White blood cell and also get to know about an important cell which may be missing from our blood. This application helps us to test and fast white blood cell detection and may reduce testing time.
